## Explicaci√≥n corta

Currently the weekly supply increase of YFI is 30,000 per week. Vote under proposal #0 is if more YFI tokens should be minted.

I‚Äôm voting ‚ÄúFOR‚Äù on proposal #0 16 as continuous incentivization of LPs is important for growth of the platform. Most of reasons are the same with proposal 5.

**M√°s razones:**

1. The YFI mining will be end in 3 days, while the whole crypto community needs more time to understand this complex mechanism. In such a short period of time, YFI cannot generate an effective market pricing.
2. To stop the YFI mining will instantly result to a huge amount remove of the liquidity, this will be a huge negative to the YFI price because of the decreasing of fee rewards.

This is a proposal for reducing the weekly issuance rate with a model the same as BTC. Two months is enough to educate the crypto community while finishing the YFI generate event.

**Pros del modelo de haviling similar al de Bitcoin:**

1. Halving every week is quite easy to be understood in the crypto community, and effective.
2. Easy to make memes of YFI - ‚Äú YFI is the Bitcoin in Defi ‚Äù for virus spreading.
3. Enough time for the markets to reach the equilibrium. (liquidity provider‚Äôs YFI revenue is halved every week while taking the same risks, will result in a steady change in liquidity)

In summary. If proposal #0 passes the issuance model should be altered as described above.

**A FAVOR**: Support the new issuance model.

**EN CONTRA**: Do not support the new issuance model.
